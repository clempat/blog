# Kids need your focus

Some time I share a photo of my kids to my friends or family. Usually we think this is something nice, so we keep in touch. The truth is I was on my mobile, took a picture and took the time to send it while I was with my kids.

Did it already happened to you that the voices are getting louder and louder until you take your eyes out of your phone and shout to your kids to be more quiet ? I won't judge you because I did it. The pandemic did not help as we had to be with them 24/24 7/7. In this post I will share my journey while trying to fix this. I hope at the end of this post I have a solution and helped people who faces the same issue.

My first step is trying to understand why I pull my iPhone during those time. What I am looking for . I will try to match my [RescueTime](https://rescuetime.com/) with my calendar events indicating I am with the kids. I am interested in the app I open and the notification I receive.

Already potential solution I have in my head:
- Mobile away
- Block notification
- Find interesting activities to do with the kids.
- Focus app with gamification
- Go through all apps before I get to the kids
